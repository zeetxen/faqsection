        <h3 class="faq-title">what is Dark Matter ?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          At the Gran Sasso underground laboratory, deep beneath the Apennine
          Mountains of central Italy, scientists are keeping watch over a giant
          tank filled with 3.5 metric tons of liquid xenon. Their hope is that
          exotic particles from deep space will whiz through the liquid,
          emitting a telltale signal. So far, that hasn’t happened. But
          scientists hunting for so-called “dark matter” have learned to be
          patient. It’s been nearly a century since astronomers studying distant
          galaxies first noticed something odd: The galaxies seemed to hold more
          matter than could be accounted for by the visible material — stars and
          gas clouds. This missing mass, dubbed dark matter, is now believed to
          make up more than a quarter of the total mass and energy in the
          visible universe.

        <h3 class="faq-title">what is Dark Energy ?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          In the 1990s, data from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed that
          distant galaxies aren’t just moving away from our home galaxy, the
          Milky Way, they’re speeding away from us (and from each other) at an
          accelerating rate. That came as a big surprise — one that scientists
          have been struggling to explain ever since. What mysterious force is
          giving the galaxies this extra push? No one knows. But it’s been
          dubbed “dark energy,” and as with dark matter, Einstein is a key
          figure in the story.

        <h3 class="faq-title">what came before the Big Bang ?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Whenever a cosmologist gives a public lecture, someone in the audience
          inevitably raises a hand to ask, “Yes, but what came before the Big
          Bang?” “There’s this textbook answer that we’re supposed to give,”
          says Glenn Starkman, a physicist at Case Western Reserve University.
          “We say that the question is meaningless, just as it’s meaningless to
          ask what’s south of the South Pole.”

        <h3 class="faq-title">what is Inside a Black Hole ?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Black holes are regions of space in which gravity exerts such an
          enormous pull that nothing — not light or any other signal of any kind
          — can escape. Since nothing can get out, it’s as if the inside of
          every black hole is permanently “pinched off” from the rest of the
          universe. “We have no idea what goes on inside a black hole — unless
          we’re willing to jump into one,” says Starkman. Even then, you’d have
          no way to get out to tell anyone what you’d found — or even to send a
          message.

        <h3 class="faq-title">Are we Alone ?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Are we the only intelligent creatures in the cosmos? The only beings
          to wonder what other thinking, wondering beings might be out there?
          Our galaxy contains several hundred billion stars, many of which are
          likely to have planets orbiting them. As if that weren’t mind-boggling
          enough, astronomers believe there at least a trillion galaxies in the
          visible universe. Given the likely profusion of planets, it seems
          unlikely that we’re alone in the universe. And so scientists around
          the world have embarked on what they call SETI, or the search for
          extraterrestrial intelligence.
